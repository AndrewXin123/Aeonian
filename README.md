# Aeonian
Aeonian is a web service that aims to automate many financial tasks to help the elderly manage their finances, improving their quality of life after retirement with a simple and accessible UI.

# Inspiration
In recent years, the population of senior citizens in America has been experiencing a worsening retirement crisis. With savings rates down, the future of Social Security in question and the American population amassing more debt, financial wellbeing is a source of stress for many households. The elderly in particular encounter struggles with critical financial responsibilities, as many are challenged with mental and physical conditions.

# What it does
Users of this website will provide their phone number, and our backend Node.js software will utilize the Twilio API to send custom calls and push notifications. With these messages, our software reminds users to make necessary payments, sends weekly financial recaps, contacts family members about potential scammer activity, and informs people about additional resources for financial assistance like Medicare, retirement benefits, and supplemental security income.
